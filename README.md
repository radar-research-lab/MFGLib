## Overview
MFGLib is an open-source Python library dedicated to solving Nash equilibria (NEs) for generic mean-field games (MFGs) with a user-friendly and customizable interface, aiming at promoting both applications and research of MFGs. On one hand, it facilitates the creation and analysis of arbitrary user-defined MFG environments with minimal prior knowledge on MFGs. On the other hand, it serves as a modular and extensible code base
for the community to easily prototype and implement new algorithms and environments of MFGs as well as their variants and generalizations.

The official documentation for MFGLib is available at https://mfglib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
